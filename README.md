### Project Description:

This project is consisting in the elaboration of a model in order to estimate the difficulty level of French texts (A1, ..., C2). We were doing this through a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/detecting-french-texts-difficulty-level-2022). 
This repository is made to display all our documentation and resources for our prediction models as well as the different attempts of data cleaning or model implementation we have made. The structure is as the following :

1. [The different CSV files we used as training and prediction data.](CSV_files)
2. [The classic models we used](Classic_models)
3. [The implementation of the model using BERT and TensorFlow](
4. The methodology
5. The different results
6. Presentation video

#### The data

We have been provided with two different datasets, one for the training (`training_data.csv`) and another unlabelled data (`unlabelled_data.csv`) in order to make predictions with our model. They were composed of sentences with their associated index as well as the difficulty level of the sentence in the `training_data.csv` file.
