## Classic Models 

This folder contains all the "classic" models that we tried on our data in order to predict the classification.
This includes the Logistic Regression, KNN, Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. For each model, we tried the model on the raw data and on the data that has been structured and cleaned by tokenization techniques, stop words and punctuation removal. 

The cleaning methods of stop words and punctuation removal did not improve the accuracy of the models.
